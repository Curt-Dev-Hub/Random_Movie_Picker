# Random_Movie_Picker
This is a project I have decided to work on which serves the purpose of being a good refresher for me on API integration, and will help stop myself and others  wasting too much time on choosing a movie to watch!

**Random Movie Picker** is a web application that helps users discover random movies to watch based on different criteria such as genre, release year, and other factors which will be added later. It utilizes RapidAPI MovieDatabase to fetch movie data and provide users with a selection of randomly chosen films.

## Current Features

- Choose a genre, release year, and language to filter the random movie selection.
- Get a list of movie genres and other useful data from the API.
- User-friendly interface for quick and easy film discovery.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Curt-Dev-Hub/random-movie-picker.git
